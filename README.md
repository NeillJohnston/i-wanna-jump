Platformer engine made with Java on libGDX.

IWJ is a little project that's a simple libGDX extension that makes creating platform games easier.

Originally it was made in Scala, then when I realized that Scala's backwards compatibility with Java is awful to deal with, I rewrote the entire thing in Java. And of course the advantage to that is you can easily write games with Scala/Kotlin/Groovy (do any others exist?).

## version
At the time of writing this readme (2017-05-16), IWJ isn't even near completed. Pre-alpha, if you will.
Still a bunch of ground to cover and bugs to test before I dare call this an "alpha" project. Author's note: that's probably a reasonable goal for about two weeks from now.
